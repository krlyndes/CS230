CS230 Week 8 Portfolio Questions

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, a client of Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to develop a web-based version of their existing game, Draw It or Lose It. The goal was to expand accessibility by creating a scalable and maintainable software solution that supports gameplay across different platforms. Their requirements focused on supporting unique team and player names, ensuring only a single game instance runs at a time, and building a foundation for future scalability.

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I successfully translated the client’s needs into clear, structured software requirements and design constraints. The documentation effectively outlined the technical goals and incorporated object-oriented principles and design patterns—such as singleton and iterator—to guide implementation. I also maintained a strong focus on future scalability and cross-platform compatibility.

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document provided a roadmap for the project. It helped clarify what the application needed to accomplish and how components would interact. By mapping out the domain model and architecture in advance, I was able to focus on writing clean, modular code that followed a consistent structure and addressed each requirement directly.

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to revise one part, I would enhance the System Architecture View section with more visual elements and specific diagrams. While the logic was clear, a visual representation of components and data flow would make the design more accessible and easier to understand, especially for teams unfamiliar with the project.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on usability, accessibility, and reliability—ensuring the game supported multiple players, functioned on modern browsers, and maintained consistent state management through a singleton pattern. Considering user needs is vital because it ensures the software is functional, intuitive, and aligned with real-world use cases. Ignoring those needs often leads to solutions that are technically sound but practically unusable.

•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design by first understanding the game’s business logic and translating it into an object-oriented structure. I used UML modeling, design patterns, and requirement analysis to create a blueprint. In future projects, I would continue using these strategies while placing more emphasis on prototyping and stakeholder feedback early in the process. This would help ensure the design aligns closely with user expectations before development begins.
